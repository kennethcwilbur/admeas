- Takeaways, Resources for further study, Acknowledgements

## Takeaways

- Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference: We can't observe all data needed to optimize actions. This is a missing-data problem, not a modeling problem.
    - Common remedies: Experiments, Quasi-experiments, Correlations, Triangulate; Ignore

- Experiments are the gold standard, but are costly and challenging to design, implement and act on

- Ad effects are subtle but that does not imply unprofitable. Measurement is challenging but required to optimize profits
